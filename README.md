# Manager README
Hey there... If you're reading this, probably worked/work/will-work together, or you want to copy my readme. In any case, I'm happy to have you here. I'm here to learn, add value, and enjoy the ride. I'm not a visionary, and probably you're smarter than me... let's start.

Feel free to ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/matiasburni) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matiasburni/?locale=en_US).

## About Me
I'm Matias. I'm from Argentina, and I'm married; I have two kids, I live in Barcelona (Spain), I'm a software engineer (more console than dev, build/release engineer, or DevOps kind). I like [padel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUOHfNaoco&ab_channel=WorldPadelTour) and mountain bike... ex frustrated [squash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTcvGK3k1IQ&ab_channel=PSASQUASHTV) player (lol). I speak Spanish/English/French, and I'm learning Catalan. I'm not an English native speaker, so please be patient; corrections are accepted (this is how I grow). I'm an extrovert, but lately, with age, I have become more selective with people in my personal life.

## My Values & Principles
**Default to action**. 
I always find something to do; my TODO list is endless as my willingness. A downside is that in some cases, I start acting before thinking, even before identifying the issue that I'm trying to solve, which leads to iterating more than desired. I'm aware of this, and I continuously loop my ideas/solutions with people around; feedback is a blessing.

**Good vibes**.
I don't want to work in a rigid environment; I want space to say what I think and add value to topics. And with time, I've learned that having good energy and being empathetic is a MUST for me; it's my way to promote a safe/relaxed environment.

**Relentless**.
I'm direct, with respect/carefulness but direct. If I see something and consider that my feedback can help, I'll share it even if it's uncomfortable. I'm also relentless; I constantly embrace input and (try to) improve my behavior/profile.

**Here to help**.
I will help you if you ask or detect that I can add value to your proposal. I'm self-organized, and I'll always find time for others. I believe that software results from social interaction (ex: PR reviews), and participating from different angles in that construction is vital for achieving outstanding results.

**People first**.
I like people and technology. Being an engineer manager combines both. We're complex systems, with commonalities and differences, in constant evolution. Reading what's around me is a challenge; people are my main challenge. Projects come and go (don't misread this, I believe in excellence). Side note... I consider that in the software industry, we're a bit spoiled and that in some cases, we lose contact with reality; I try to be honest with my truth and transmit that to people.

## Strengths.
* Hard worker. I will always try, over and over.
* Create bonds across teams/organizations. I like connecting people and connecting to people.
* Customer-oriented. I want to understand what you need deeply.

## Weaknesses
* I provide too much context before going to the point in some cases.
* Recognition. I usually put people's achievements over mine, to the point that I rarely take credit for my achievements.
* Clarity sharing strategies orally. Speaking, I could look messy even if my proposal is evident in my brain. I tend to write a lot because this process helps me organize the pitch. (if you see long agendas, don't worry is more a script than something for you).
  * In some cases, being a non-English speaker doesn't help here.
* I use too much "I don't know" when in fact, I know.
* English.

## Our Average Week
We will have a  1:1 every week for at least 30 minutes. 
* These meetings are for you first, and me second
* These are not status meetings unless you want them to be. I prefer offline status reports
* We both can add topics to the agenda, you have priority. We should add talking points prior to each meeting
* Focus of this meeting: Help, get context, resolve issues (blockers), and grow career
  * Personal connection
  * How you're feeling at work
  * Feedback (you and them)
  * Improving team/company
  * Learning/growth
  * Work engagement
  * Questions or information you need
* Note: [200 One-On-One Meeting Questions for Managers](https://fellow.app/blog/2019/one-on-one-meeting-questions-for-managers/)

Do not wait if you have something urgent. Slack me immediately, and we will get on a video call

## Communication
In order of preference:
* face to face
* face to face in zoom
* Slack
* other

Probably we're in different time zones, so my answer won't be instant in Slack or emails.

## My Assumptions
* You have good intentions
* You're here to help and learn
* You will ask if something is not clear
* You won't monopolize a discussion
* You understand that we have roles to add value from different perspectives

## My Calendar
Public and available, and my business hours too. 
Feel free to set up a 1:1 or to invite me to a meeting, if I can't I'll say "no" or reschedule.
I'm in Europe and for most of my career, I worked with different time zones, mostly us-west, which means a 9hs shift. I learned to work in this environment (async, write, be clear, give context, consistent, etc)... but in some cases meetings are necessary.

**Wednesday I work until 12:00 Pacific time (PST), please use my time wisely**

## Feeback
I like receiving it in any form, at any time.

I like giving it, and it's also part of my role. Always assume best intentions from me, giving feedback is hard and it takes time, if I do it is because I care about you.

Please be timely with feedback because I'll try to take action asap or enjoy it asap. :)
